<h3><body> Netflix Series Essay: Lucifer </body></h3>

allign="middle"<p>For this little essay I will be speaking about a live action series by 
the name of "Lucifer." The show itself is about the ups, downs and abnormal 
events that all revolve around the odd life of the fallen angel himself,
Lucifer. From dealing with demons in disguise running around the mortal 
plane, to going up against his angellic siblings from time to time, it
doesn't stop to show just how outlandish it can be with this idea. This
is definitely a series some can get into if they give it a chance.


<p>I personally enjoy the series as a whole simply because of how different 
its take on portraying Lucifer is. Coupled with how it dances around with
various objects and entities in its mythos, it makes for a very enjoyable
series. One other thing I enjoy is how it works with other characters in 
the bibilcal mythology, introducing them in various ways that one wouldn't
really expect.


<p>Coming from me, I think folks should give this series a chance simply due to
how it does what it wants with the mythologies seen in the bible, while still
keeping true to what was shown in said mytholigies. The portral of each 
character in every episode is done very well and the production value is 
definintely high in quality. If you're one who takes interest in stories that
play around with biblical stories, this series is one that I can definitely
recommend.
